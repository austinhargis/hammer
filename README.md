# hammer
hammer is an inventory management system developed in Python with a Tkinter GUI and a SQLite3 database.

## Note
hammer is still in very early development. Changes can and will happen, and your current databases may not work in later
versions of hammer. 

## Requirements
In order to run hammer in its current state, you will need to install:
- Python 3.11
  - This is the version that we are currently targeting, but it should work with any fairly recent version of Python.
- SQLite3
  - This should come preinstalled with Python
- sv-ttk
  - This can be installed via PIP or from the developer's [GitHub](https://github.com/rdbende/Sun-Valley-ttk-theme).
  - Note: The current working build of hammer does not use this. However, it is likely that we will implement this in
    the near future.
- Tkinter
  - This should come preinstalled with Python.
- webbrowser
  - This should come preinstalled with Python.
